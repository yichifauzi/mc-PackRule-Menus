# Data-Pack / Game-Rule Menus

Makes the titular menus accessible from the pause menu in singleplayer worlds.


## Word of caution: Datapacks

Minecraft's own built-in datapacks are not "just" datapacks, and require special handling. A warning screen will be shown whenever you attempt to toggle any of these, and give you the option to back out. 

### Experimental Feature
When packs that include experimental features (such as bundles) are toggled, the approriate feature flag will be toggled on the world.

However, **unlike regular datapacks, those won't fully take effect until the world is restarted.** After you confirm the changes, the world will immediately exit.

### Vanilla Datapack
The Vanilla datapack can technically be disabled, but the uses cases for this are very marginal. Doing so will break worlds most of the times, so you probably don't want to do it.
An additional warning screen will appear when trying to disable this pack.

If you can't load a world after having disabled the Vanilla datapack, loading it in Safe Mode should be able to restore it.
